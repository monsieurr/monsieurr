### Hi there ðŸŒ±

Currently doing consulting work most of the week.

Rest of the time when I am not running, talking, going out or doing photography I am learning about AI, green IT and data stuff.

I published my websites a few months ago, one profesionnal and dev oriented and the other to showcase my creative/art work.
I am passionate about learning, particularly if it's about solving problems or making art.

## My websites
