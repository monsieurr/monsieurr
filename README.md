### Hi there ðŸŒ±

I am currently working on some programming projects, mostly using either the MERN stack or Python.
I recently published my websites, one profesionnal and dev oriented and the other to showcase my creative/art work.
I am passionate about learning new stuff, particularly if it's about solving problems or making art.

## My websites
